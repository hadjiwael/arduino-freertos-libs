REQUIRMENTS

These libraries have been tested with Arduino 0023. They are not
compatible with Arduino 1.0.

INSTALLATION

Copy these two directories into the libraries directory of your Arduino
sketchbook.

INCLUDED LIBRARIES

* ArduinoFreeRTOS:

The library ArduinoFreeRTOS packages the FreeRTOS 6.1.0 kernel into a
library that works with the Arduino IDE. It has been tested with the
Arduino Mega 2560.

Please see the file ArduinoFreeRTOS/LICENSE for the FreeRTOS license.

An example sketch is provided to demonstrate kernel initialization and
multitasking using a mutex to protect a shared resource.

* RTOSSerial: 

The RTOSSerial library is based on Mike Smith's FastSerial library,
which is part of the ArduPilot project. It uses FreeRTOS queues as
buffers for ISR-driven serial read and write. The ArduinoFreeRTOS
library is required for RTOSSerial to work properly. RTOSSerial has been
tested with the Arduino Mega 2560.

An example sketch, derived from the FastSerial example sketch,
demonstrates the RTOSSerial's expanded BetterStream interface and 

The RTOSSerial library is released under a BSD-compatible license.

* Makefile support:

The file Arduino.mk, authored by Mike Smith and part of the Ardupilot
project, is included. It may be useful for building the example
sketches from the command line.
